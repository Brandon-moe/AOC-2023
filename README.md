# AOC-2023
Advent of Code Solutions for 2023  
This year I set out to see how far into the month I could make it solving the puzzles with SQL. I had no expectation to get much further than the first couple days.  
✅**Day 1** - Simple enough, produced a somewhat hacky solution that reads rows backwards and compares them against a backwards regex.  
✅**Day 2** - Pretty simple again, input could be split automatically into useful columns. Some janky repetition in the query as functions had to be applied across multiple columns indepently.   
❌**Day 3** - First day to introduce the 2nd dimension in a puzzle input, an obvious point of difficulty in SQL. Made an attempt but the 2D array computations were too convoluted and resigned to solve in Python.  
〽️**Day 4** - Part 1 very straightforward in SQL. Part 2 certainly doable with reasonable effort, but didn't have the time/energy to push through it
